# PacketLens

PacketLens is a lightweight and portable debugging proxy designed for developers and testers.  
It focuses on simplicity and isolation: instead of applying a proxy across your entire system, PacketLens attaches the proxy only to the browser session it opens.  

This makes it easier to debug traffic in a controlled environment without interfering with other applications.

## ✨ Features
- **Portable & Lightweight** – No heavy installation required.
- **Session-Isolated Proxy** – Debug traffic only in the browser session opened by PacketLens.
- **System-Friendly** – Leaves your global proxy settings untouched.
- **Developer-Focused** – Ideal for debugging APIs, web apps, and isolated test environments.

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Download the latest release from the section.
2. Launch PacketLens exe, portable version, no installation required.
3. A dedicated browser session will open with the proxy applied.
4. Start debugging traffic without affecting your system-wide settings.

## 🛠️ Use Cases
